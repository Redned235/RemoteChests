Creating Remote Chests:
------------
The idea for this plugin is that it's lightweight, and easy to use. Just look at a chest and run /rc create <name>. 
You can set this name to whatever you please and then you're easily able to open that chest with /rc open <name>. 
If you feel like you want to remove a chest's remote access, jst run /rc delete <name>. 
This does not remove the chest, only remote access to it.
